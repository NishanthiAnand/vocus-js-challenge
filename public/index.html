          <h1>Vocus JavaScript Challenge</h1>

          <p>
            Nice work making it to the next step towards working with us Vocus. This is a simple programming
            challenge that we use here at Vocus Digital to determine how comfortable you are with the
            some of the technology we use day-to-day.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the role you're applying for, we'll ask you to either complete the front-end challenge, or the api challenge (or both).
            Feel free to do both challenges anyway for bonus points.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Remember:</strong> there are no wrong answers. This is a creative challenge, and we only
            use this to understand how you approach and solve engineering problems ðŸ˜€

          <h2 id="api">The API Challenge</h2>

          <p><sub>Anticipated duration: ~90-120 minutes</sub></p>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>

          <p>
            We've provided a basic Express server with 3 REST endpoints - each which are simply returning a static JSON payload. Uh-oh - anybody can hit these endpoints without being authorized ðŸ˜®
          </p>

          <p>
            We'd like you to implement JWT authentication against all of the REST endpoints. This will involve:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Implementing a new <code>/login</code> endpoint. This only needs to be a mock endpoint and only needs to accept a username.
                The list of mock usernames is in the <code>users.json</code> file.
              </li>
              <li>Successfully signing in should grant a user a <strong>refresh token</strong> and an <strong>access token</strong>.</li>
              <li>Refresh token expiry should be configurable, with a default value of 60 seconds.</li>
              <li>The user's email and role should be encoded into the JWT.</li>
              <li>Your implementation of authorization should be compatible with many concurrent sessions.</li>
              <li>A request with an invalid access token should revoke the associated refresh token.</li>
              <li>Non-authorized users should get a <code>401</code> HTTP error code.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

            <p>Feel free to use any dependencies as you see fit - just explain why you used them in your readme. We definitely anticipate that you'll need at least a crypto library.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>API is containerized with Docker or similar.</li>

          <p><sub>Anticipated duration: ~90-120 minutes</sub></p>

          <h3>Instructions</h3>

          <p>
            Vocus support wants a dashboard to see a brief overview of their customers. You'll need to build an Angular or React app
            following the provided design.
          </p>

          <p>
            The team lead has given the following requirements:
          </p>

          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Client app must be built in the <code>/client</code> directory.</li>
              <li>You must use the provided API's.</li>
              <li>Solutions must be implemented in Angular, React or Vanilla JavaScript.</li>
              <li>A Webpack configuration has been provided for convenience, but using it is <strong>optional</strong>.</li>
              <li>You may build your app in the `public/customers.html` file, or run your own web server (ng serve/create-react-app etc).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <br />

          <h4>Design</h4>

          <p>We've used the Bootstrap design language to create a UI, and the Bootstrap CSS bundle has already been included on the page. Clicking on the user card should toggle the visiblity of the users details and dismiss any other cards which are expanded.</p>
